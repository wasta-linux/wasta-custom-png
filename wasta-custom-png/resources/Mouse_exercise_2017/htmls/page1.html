		<h1>Welcome to Mouserobics!</h1>
		Click the underlined two below. Here is how:</br>
		<ol>
			<li>With the mouse straight up and down, rest heel of your hand on the table in front of the mouse.</li>
			<li>Hold the mouse between thumb and ring and little fingers. See the picture at the right top-corner</li>
			<li>Use thumb and fingers to move the tip of the arrow onto the underlined two.</li>
			<p id="link2"><a href="page2.html">2</a></p>
			<li>When the arrow becomes a pointing finger,</li>
			<li>hold the mouse still.</li>
			<li>Lightly click the mouse button with your index finger.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Click the left mouse button.</li>
				<li>If the next page doesn't appear after you click, you aren't holding the mouse still when clicking.</br>
					The lighter you click the better clicking works.</br>
					Keep trying.
			</ul>
		</ol>
